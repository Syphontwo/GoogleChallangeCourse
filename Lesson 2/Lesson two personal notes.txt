OVERALL NOTES I feel are important for me
 taking into account previous knowledge

USE https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element to tags up
USE https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input to help with validation

Make sure you lookup the type of tag to use
Doc Type declaration at the top of the document.  And you don't have to close it

I am learning HTML5

Body is the visible section, head contains meta-data

<meta charset="utf-8"> to display unicode
