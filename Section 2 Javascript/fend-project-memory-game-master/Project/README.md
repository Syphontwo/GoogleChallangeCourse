## How to Play
The game will begin immediately upon load.

Click any of the squares to see the card underneath.  Once two cards are clicked, if they match, they will turn green and remain visible.  If they do not match, they will turn red and remain visible only for a moment, then they will disappear again.

Scoring is based purely on the number of moves, so take your time and CONCENTRATE!

## Dependencies

## Contributing

This is a project for a class.  Therefore, no contributions or pulls will be accepted until the project has been completed and graded to ensure that all work is my own.  Even after project completion, I will likely not be accepting any pull requests to the code here.  I will likely only accept pull requests adding to my various notes scattered about the different areas in the larger repo rather than this one singular project.
