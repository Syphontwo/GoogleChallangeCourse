## Contributing

This is a project for a class.  Therefore, no contributions or pulls will be accepted until the project has been completed and graded to ensure that all work is my own.  Even after project completion, I will likely not be accepting any pull requests to the code here.  I will likely only accept pull requests adding to my various notes scattered about the different areas in the larger repo rather than this one singular project.
