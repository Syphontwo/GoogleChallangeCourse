.parent() - selects 1 level up in the DOM tree
.parents() - selects all parents up the tree with the optional selector (or all if none given)
.children() - selects all immediate children
.find() - like .parents, finds all children and grandchildren with an optional selector
.siblings() - selects all items on the same level of the DOM tree with an optional selector

'*' is a wildcard to select all

/*
For this quiz, use articleList and DOM navigation methods to collect articleList's
sibling <h1> (var h1), children (var kids), and parent <div>s (var parents).

You must use articleList to navigate to the element(s)!
*/

// Start with these variable!
var articleList, h1, kids, parents;

articleList = $('.article-list');

h1 = articleList.siblings('h1');// Your code goes here!

kids = articleList.children();// Your code goes here!

parents = articleList.parents('div');// Your code goes here!
