if you select elements of a class, then add another one, the original declaration isn't updated, so events won't be listened to

$( '.container' ).on( 'click', 'article', function() { â€¦ });

...this code tells jQuery to watch the .container element for clicks, and then if there are any, check if the click event's target is an article element.

this can also be used to optimize the number of listeners.
