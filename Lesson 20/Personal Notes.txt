in CHROME CONSOLE ONLY use monitorEvents(elementToWatch) to see events in the console

example console to watch

right click on the element, click inspect
In console monitorEvents($0)

in JavaScript
$(element).on('eventToListenFor', callbackFunction)


lots of silly confusing things are done in the name of "convenience"
