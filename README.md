# GoogleChallangeCourse

This is a collection of notes, exercises, and other nuggets I felt were a good idea to compile into a single source for my own later review.

This is being offered publicly for others to learn from as they wish. No code here is meant to be stand-alone or really useful in any way.

The organization is simple:
 Each lesson is divided into a folder
  Each lesson segment is signified with the number and a - followed by a brief explanation
  At the end of each Lesson, there is a a section on personally compiled notes of key points.
Files have the correct extension.

I will do my best to keep it so each commit corresponds with the addition of files relevant to each lesson part.
