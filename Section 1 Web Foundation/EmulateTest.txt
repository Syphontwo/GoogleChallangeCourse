Chrome developer tools has an emulator for many different devices.

It's the icon that looks vaguely like a phone at the top of the dev panel.


Turn on Dev mode on the android device
Turn on USB debugging
Chrome Canary (desktop)
Chrom beta (device)

Chrome inspect while phone has website open
can then inspect the mobile pages from a dev machine, even screen cast
