link a stylesheet using a query to use different ones for different media

small files, more requests
<link rel"stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width:500px)" href="over500.css">

print is the only other media to worry about

larger files, less requests
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
  body {
    CSS HERE
  }
}

DON'T USE - @import url("over500.css") only screen and (min-width: 500px);

Rules Stack in standard CSS rule precedence, i.e. if 2 rules match,
both apply
