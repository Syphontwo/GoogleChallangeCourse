DIPs = Device Independent Pixels
  These help with retina displays and the like
Hardware Pixels - actual specced

DPR - device Pixel Ratio
  DIP / Hardware   1 dimensional

Don't forget to set the viewport size to help with consistency
The following command sets CSS to the same as DIPs
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">

setting max-width: 100%; for img, embed, object, video is a good idea on almost all pages
