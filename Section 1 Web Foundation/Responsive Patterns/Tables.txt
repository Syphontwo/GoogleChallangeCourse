Hidden Columns:
  Hide columns as data viewport gets smaller
  use display: none to hide stuff

problem with that is hiding content from a user

No More Tables:
  At smaller sizes, tables are collapsed into a list instead of a table
  At smaller sizes
    table, thead, tbody, th, td, tr {
      display: block;
    }
    thead tr {
    //display: none; this would cause accessibility issues with screen readers
    //below block is how you can hide it without causing accessibility issues
      position: absolute;
      top: -9999px;
      left: -9999px;
    }
    td {
      position: relative;
      passing-left: 50%;
    }
    td:before {
      position: absolute;
      left: 6px;
      content: attr(data-th);
      font-weight: bold;
    }


  Contained Scrolling:
    At smaller sizes, table will stay the same size, but will scroll
    Wrap table in a div
    div.containedtable {
      width: 100%;
      overflow-x: auto;
    }
