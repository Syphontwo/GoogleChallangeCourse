var x = 1;

while (x <= 20) {
    var result = "";
    if (x % 3 === 0){
        result += "Julia";
    }
    if (x % 5 === 0){
        result += "James";
    }
    console.log(result ? result : x);
    x++;
}

The use of the ternary at the end takes advantage of JavaScript coercion since "" is == false

This also helps me realize that ternaries use coercion == rather than direct comparison ===
