CSS "parts" are called rulesets!!!
CSS rulesets can go in the header under the style tag
Give HTML elements ID or class to identify them uniquely, or refer to the "tag" to change them called
CSS class .classname, ID #IDname

SPACES IN CLASS GIVE IT MULTIPLE CLASSES!!!!!!  IDs must have no spaces because an element can only have 1
