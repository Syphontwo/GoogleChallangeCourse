http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/

give it a class name, it adds if it isn't there, or removes if it is (hence toggle, not add or remove class)
When giving the class name as the argument, don't include the . in the front


/*
For this quiz, use a jQuery class selector and featuredArticle variable to toggle the 'featured' class!
*/

// don't change this variable!
var featuredArticle;

featuredArticle = $('.featured');// your code starts here!
featuredArticle.toggleClass('featured');
