append, preppend, insertBefore, insertAfter

append and prepend, put the whole element in as text, the HTML that is
the above add them as the first / last CHILD elements
$('#family2').append("<div id='bruce'></div>");

insertBefore and insertAfter add them as siblings, same way of doing it
$("<div id='family2'></div>").insertAfter('#family1');

AFTER and BEFORE have more normal syntax, act on a selector, theninsert something
$('#family1').After("<div id='family2'></div>");
