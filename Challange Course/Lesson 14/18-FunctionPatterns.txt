functions stored as variables and passed into another function are called "Callbacks"

variables assigned a function can also be named functions rather than anonymous, but you must call that function using the variable name not the function name

Inline functions are very similar to lamba patterns in C# in behavior.

EXAMPLE:
  var ExpressionFunction = function twoParts(callbackFunction, inputVariable){
   return callbackFunction() + inputVariable;
  }

  console.log(ExpressionFunction(function InlineFunction(){return 1; }, 2));
