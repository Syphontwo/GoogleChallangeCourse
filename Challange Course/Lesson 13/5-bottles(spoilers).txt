var num = 99;

var bottle = function(numIn){
    var result = numIn + " bottles";
    if (num === 1){
        result = numIn + " bottle";
    }
    return result;
}

while (num >0) {
    var lyrics = bottle(num) + " of juice on the wall! "+ bottle(num) + " of juice! Take one down, pass it around... ";
    num -= 1;
    lyrics +=  bottle(num) + " of juice on the wall!";
    console.log(lyrics);
}

Wanted to save this due to the use of functions.  I added that myself, it wasn't part of the lesson.
