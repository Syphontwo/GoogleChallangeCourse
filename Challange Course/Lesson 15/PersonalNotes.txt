length is property not method

splice is used for manipulation like adding and deleting elements at specific places.

stack = pop
FIFO = shift

forEach can only mutate elements using the (element, index, array) array and index parameters.  The element passed in is by value, not by reference.
map returns new array with the return of the function, doesn't touch the original.
