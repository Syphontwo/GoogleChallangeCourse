the selector must be on the tag that is being altered, note how I needed to add the .find in there

/*
For this quiz, set the href of the <a> in the first nav item to "#1".

You must use jQuery's attr() method!
*/

// Start with this variable!
var navList;

navList = $('.nav-item');// your code goes here!
navList.first().find('a').attr('href', '#1');
