typeof will return "object" not the "type" of the object.
Objects are defined as a list of key, value pairs

property names follow similar to C# convention (but know that they CAN be different if surrounded by quotes)
no hyphens

both valid
myObject["key"]
myObject.key

if there are spaces, starting with a number, or hyphens only bracket notation is usable.
