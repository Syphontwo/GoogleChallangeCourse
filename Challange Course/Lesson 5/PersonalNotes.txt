CSS "parts" are called rulesets!!!
CSS rulesets can go in the header under the style tag
Give HTML elements ID or class to identify them uniquely, or refer to the "tag" to change them called
CSS class .classname, ID #IDname
units should always be included at the end of a number

Colors in hexadecimal format can have shorthand, I personally think that is a bad idea...
 #0000ff can be shortened to #00f
 more shorthand https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties

SPACES IN CLASS GIVE IT MULTIPLE CLASSES!!!!!!  IDs must have no spaces because an element can only have 1
