Hoisting - declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

AS WRITTEN:
  sayGreeting();

  function sayGreeting(){
   console.log(greeting);
   var greeting = "hello";
  }

AS INTERPRETED:
  function sayGreeting(){
   var greeting;
   console.log(greeting);
   greeting = "hello";
  }

  sayGreeting();

OUTPUT:
 undefined


 JavaScript hoists function declarations and variable declarations to the top of the current scope.
 Variable assignments are not hoisted.
 Declare functions and variables at the top of your scripts, so the syntax and behavior are consistent with each other.
